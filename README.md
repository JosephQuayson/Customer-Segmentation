     # Customer Segmentation 

     ### DATA:
     
     1. Our data is about customers of a mall and their spending information.
     2. Each customer has their age recorded 

     ### Models or Algorithms used:

     1. KMeans
     2. Kmeans-Shift 
     3. Gaussian Mixture Model

     ### Mode Evaluation (Performance):

     1. Both K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models were good Candidates
     2. Kmeans shift algorithm performed poorly 
     3. The silhouette score for the K-Means model  was slightly higher than the Gaussian Mixture Models
     3. This shows that K-means has a quality cluster given the distribution of the data.
